<h1 align="center">Recommended Online Resources</h1>
Below are some recommended online resources that can help you with the course material. These resources are not mandatory, but they can be very helpful in understanding the concepts covered in the course.

## Gilbert Strang: MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra
This is the OG of linear algebra courses and the one I used when I had to prepare for this course when it ran first time back in 2014. The course is available on [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/). It includes lecture notes, assignments, and exams. The course is taught by Gilbert Strang, a renowned mathematician and professor at MIT. The lectures are clear and concise, and the course covers a wide range of topics in linear algebra. The course is also available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8&si=rZQQ4drlVlNjZouU) that inlcudes an interview with Prof. Strang.


## 3blue1brown
[3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) is a YouTube channel that provides visual explanations of various mathematical concepts, including linear algebra. The videos are engaging and can help you understand the material better. The channel is run by Grant Sanderson, who has a knack for making complex topics accessible and enjoyable. The videos are well-produced and often include animations that illustrate the concepts being discussed. The [Essence of linear algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=XoMhr3pWWvTMMs9a) is definitely worth watching,   but it does not cover all the material in the course.

## Sheldnon Axler: Linear Algebra Done Right
In terms of books, I would recommend "Linear Algebra Done Right" by Sheldon Axler. This book takes a different approach to linear algebra, focusing on the concepts and ideas rather than the computational aspects. It is well-written and provides a clear understanding of the subject. The book is available for free online [here](https://linear.axler.net/).

## Khan Academy
[Khan Acedemy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) has a comprehensive linear algebra course that covers the basics and more advanced topics. The course includes video lectures, practice exercises, and quizzes to help you reinforce your understanding of the material. The platform is user-friendly and allows you to learn at your own pace. There is also a [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFD0EB975BA0CC1E0&si=5Qj87vhmON44_-dv) that covers the same material.
