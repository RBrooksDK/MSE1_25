The session will also cover the concepts of powers and the transpose of a matrix. We will explore several important theorems that describe the properties of matrix operations, including the definition and properties of invertible matrices.

A detailed description can be found in the course description or by reviewing the description of each session in the Sessions menu.</p> How does the course relate to the curriculum? <p>The course primarily relates to the curriculum by providing a foundation for understanding and applying mathematics in an engineering context, especially within data science, machine learning, and computer graphics.</p> What are the prerequisites for the course? <p>It is important that you have a basic understanding of mathematics and algebra, as the course builds on these topics. It is recommended to have completed high school mathematics, especially topics such as functions, equations, and basic algebra.</p> Is attendance mandatory? <p>Yes, the course has a mandatory attendance policy which means you will be unable to attend the exam if your attendance surpasses 25%.</p>"},{"location":"pages/faq/#who-to-contact","title":"Who to Contact?","text":"Who should I contact if I have questions about the course content? <p>You can contact the course coordinator, Richard Brooks, if you have questions about the course content.</p> Who should I contact if I have questions about the exam? <p>You should always contact Student Services if you have questions about the exam.</p> Who should I contact if I have questions about the schedule? <p>You can contact our scheduler if you have questions about the schedule.</p> Who should I contact if I have scheduling conflicts? <p>You can contact our scheduler if you have questions about scheduling conflicts.</p> Who should I contact to find out if this course is mandatory for a graduate program or if it fulfills a specific requirement? <p>You can contact Study Guidance.</p>"},{"location":"pages/faq/#exam-and-assessment","title":"Exam and Assessment","text":"What type of exam concludes the course? <p>Please see the \"Exam\" section in the tab above for detailed information about the exam.</p> When are the exam and re-exam held? <p>The exam is typically held in January, and the re-exam is usually in early February. Feel free to contact Student Services for more information.</p> What is the grading scale for the course? <p>The grading scale for the course is the 7-point scale.</p> How is the final grade calculated? <p>The final grade is based on the exam. The exam consists of two parts: a Flowlock exam in Wiseflow and a Wiseflow exam without Flowlock. The two parts do not have separate weightings, and the assessment and grade are based on an overall evaluation. Please see the \"Exam\" section in the tab above for more information.</p> How is the re-exam conducted? <p>The re-exam may be oral.

Please see the \"Exam\" section in the tab above for more information.</p> What happens if I fail the re-exam? <p>If you fail the re-exam, you will have to wait until the course is offered again to take the exam again. In special cases, we may be able to offer you an oral re-exam. Please see the \"Exam\" section in the tab above for more information.</p> What percentage do I need to pass the exam? <p>The exam is graded according to the 7-point scale. To pass the exam, you need a grade of 02 or higher. To achieve 02, you must score at least 50% of the total points on the exam. This score may vary from year to year but is never higher than 50%.</p>"},{"location":"pages/faq/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"Is the course book mandatory? <p>The course book is not mandatory, but I recommend finding resources that can help you understand the material.
