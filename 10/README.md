### Session Preparation

Brooks: [Chapter 10](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RBrooksDK/MSE_book_v2/master/main.pdf)

Some of the exercises may require you to use Python. You may also need to install the `numpy` and `sympy` libraries if you haven't already.

### Exercises

Python solutions will be available after the session.
<!--**[Python]** Means that you are advised to use Python to solve the exercise. You can find the Python solutions [here](https://github.com/RBrooksDK/MSE1_25/blob/main/10/Python_solutions_for_exercises_10.ipynb) or download them [here](Python_solutions_for_exercises_10.ipynb)-->

#### Exercise 1

**[Python]** Given

$A=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9\end{array}\right]$ and $B=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}9 & 8 & 7 \\ 6 & 5 & 4 \\ 3 & 2 & 1\end{array}\right]$.

Solve the matrix equation $X-A=6(X+B)$.

??? answer "&nbsp;"

    $X=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}-11 & -10 & -9 \\ -8 & -7 & -6 \\ -5 & -4 & -3\end{array}\right]$

#### Exercise ?

Velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time. 

Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.

1. Given the position function of a car $s(t) = 5t^2 + 2t + 1$, where $t$ is in seconds and $s(t)$ is in meters, find the velocity function.

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"

        Velocity function: $v(t) = 10t + 2$ m/s        

2. Knowing that acceleration is the derivative of velocity, find the acceleration function.

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"

        Acceleration function: $a(t) = 10$ m/s²

3. Calculate the velocity and acceleration of the car at $t = 3$ seconds.

    ??? answer "&nbsp;"

        Velocity at $t = 3$ seconds: $v(3) = 32$ m/s

        Acceleration at $t = 3$ seconds: $a(3) = 10$ m/s²
